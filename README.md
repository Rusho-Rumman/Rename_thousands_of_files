I wrote this script just to rename thousand of handheld games that I had on my PC. So, Basically, in this code, I select a certain directory where this script will be executed. 
In my case, All my games are named with something like "001, 002...111" etc. 
So, this script will remove that digits from the front and rename it as it is.
